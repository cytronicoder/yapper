# Yapper

Yapper is an open-source project that allows IB students to receive feedback on their assessments with ease (and without having to email their teachers a thousand times). It uses the OpenAI API to generate responses, and it's powered by the [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org).

## How to use

1. Put the question in.
2. Put the 7-8 strands for the particular criterion in.
3. Put your response in.
4. Analyze! Suggestions will show up on the side.

## Future plans

I'm planning to integrate Google Docs/local file imports soon for both the response and criterion sheet parts.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to [Thomas](https://github.com/TakumiBC) for writing the initial iteration of the feedback prompt that was subsequently revised and expanded on in the API, and to [Arpan](https://github.com/Arpan-206) for the OpenAI API access.
